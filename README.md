👋 Hi, I’m João Guimarães! 
From motorcycles to camping in the middle of nature to trying exotic foods! And always with a craft beer from a random country!
🌱 I’m currently learning relational database at freecodecamp and then I'll review my front-end skills (html, css, javascript and maybe learn React!). 
If you want, you can suggest something to learn, I'm open to anything!
