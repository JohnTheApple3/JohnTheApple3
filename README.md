ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m JoÃ£o GuimarÃ£es! After a leap of faith, I threw myself into the IT world by joining Code Academy's FullStack bootcamp!
I'm working on some projects and as soon as possible I'll post them here for you to see! 
wish me luck!

From motorcycles to camping in the middle of nature to trying exotic foods! And always with a craft beer from a random country!
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m reviewing everuthing about relational database at freecodecamp and then I'll review my front-end skills (html, css, javascript and maybe learn React!). 


If you want, you can suggest something to learn, I'm open to anything!
